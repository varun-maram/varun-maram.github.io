Happy to share that our paper "[Quantum CCA-Secure PKE, Revisited](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-57728-4_7)" received a best paper award at [PKC 2024](https://pkc.iacr.org/2024/) (also my second PKC best paper award in a row!), and is invited to the [Journal of Cryptology](https://iacr.org/jofc/)!! Many thanks to my co-author [Navid Alamati](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research/navid-alamati.html) for his excellent mentorship during my internship at [Visa Research](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research.html), and also for his skills at the pool and ping-pong tables during our breaks.
